### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jude Capachietti.  I am a creative data scientist and design thinker with experience in python, statistical analysis, machine learning, and time series analysis. With a background in math education and non-profit management, I use data storytelling to help make numbers, data, and abstract ideas make sense to people and organizations so that they can make informed data-driven decisions.
