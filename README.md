### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Jude Capachietti.  I am a creative data scientist and design thinker with experience in python, statistical analysis, machine learning, and time series analysis. With a background in math education and non-profit management, I use data storytelling to help make numbers, data, and abstract ideas make sense to people and organizations so that they can make informed data-driven decisions.

## Highlighted Projects

#### [Machine Learning Webapps and my personal website](https://github.com/jude253/pythonBackendModelAPI)

I built this webapp using Flask as a webapp server; python, numpy, pytorch for machine learning; and as a way to showcase my programming abilities. I have a text analysis classifier which shows metrics on the tone of text.  These are whether the tone sounds positive or negative, whether the gender of the author sounds male, or female, and the age it sounds like the author is.  Eventually I plan on using these metrics in a google chrome extension called "Text Tone Checker" or something along these lines.  My target market is people writing emails.  I want to empower them by offering tools to proof their tone, and the tone of those they interact with, to make their text interactions eaiser.  This projext is in the alpha phase currently.  I built the classiers using both Deep Averaging Neural Networks and using a Random Forest.  I trained the text classifiers on the [Blog Authorship Corpus](https://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~koppel/BlogCorpus.htm) which has been somewhat of a logistical challenge, but nothing that I cannot handle.  I can talk at length about the issues I have encountered, but I will save that for another day.  For the sentimetnt analysis classifier I used amazon product reviews with postive and negative labels.  I am happy with the way this classifier works, but I believe it tends to be overconfident.  In the future, I plan to expand the text data I used to train these classifiers and also to not overfit the classifiers to the dataset as well.  I believe they currently may be a little overfit to these specific text examples.  Additionally, I have a name gender classifier.  It is under portfolio, and "Name Gender Classifier."  It estimates the gender of an entered name.  I built this classifier using a bayesian predictive model and numpy.  I have it running in python backend of my webpage.  I have noticed that at times the math that is done in my deployment environment does not come out to be the same as when I trained this model in Jupyter Notebooks.  I do not know what is causing this.  One potential solution to this issue, is for me to train and deploy this model in the Microsoft Azure or AWS Machine Learning Environment, so that I have an endpoint built for ML algorithms and it will likely be more consisitent with the math.  I believe this classifier works reasonably well on my webpage.  In my Jupyter Notebook it had 80% accuracy on my test set, which is 30% better than a 50/50 guess.  I would love any feedback on this project.  It has many parts, and I have designed the architecture and implemented it all myself.  You can see the project in its current state down below!
